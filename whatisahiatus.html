<h1 style="font-size:250%"> So what is a hiatus?</h1>
<p>For the purposes of this tracker, a hiatus is hereby defined to be the length of time beginning from the release of the last episode in a previously announced schedule on any platform to the release of the first episode on any platform in another announced schedule wherein the latter schedule would have been announced after the release of the last episode in the former schedule unless said aforementioned first episode release occurs prematurely due to an accidental release or leak, in which case said release would take precedent and be considered to be the starting point of another hiatus. As such, the hiatus can thus be subdivided into the amounts of time before and after the announcement of the latter schedule.</p>
